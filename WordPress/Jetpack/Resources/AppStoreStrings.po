"We’ve added some changes in the block editor to make your publishing experience even better.\n"
"\n"
"- No more copying and pasting alt text—when you add an item in the media library to an Image block, the item’s alt text is carried over with it.\n"
"- You can insert media from a URL in Video blocks.\n"
"- If a block contains unexpected or invalid content, you can use the block recovery option to display the content properly—without re-adding it all from scratch.\n"
"\n"
"Post comments are a bit user friendlier, too. When you hit the @ symbol to mention another user in your comment, the post or comment author comes first in the list of suggested users. Sweet.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, we fixed a problem with the editor’s media picker where search queries would stick around even after closing and reopening the window. We also squashed a bug that made the app crash when adding multiple items to a Story post.\n"
