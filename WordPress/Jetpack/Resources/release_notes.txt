Buckle up, this update’s a doozy.

First off, we added the All Domains screen so you can manage all your domains in one place within the app. There’s no place like home.

Next, we made updates to Site Media.

- The Site Media screen design has better menus, file selection and sharing, and more. It even runs faster—no more jerky GIFs or stalled-out videos.
- You can use the pan gesture to select multiple media files at once. It’s also easier to swipe from one photo to another, change metadata, and delete items.
- On iPad, you can switch between square image previews and aspect ratio.
- We fixed issues with blank placeholder images, incorrect messages, document sharing, and occasional crashes.

We’re not done yet. We also made big changes to Posts & Pages.

- The Posts & Pages screen got a facelift with clean, simple display options.
- Use more advanced search features, like author and tag filters, to find the content you’d like to edit. Search also works across all authors (unless, of course, you want content from one specific person.)
- Use swipe actions to view, share, or delete posts and pages. Sweet.
- The context menu now lets you access comments, settings, and other actions for a post or page.
- We fixed issues with page refreshes and visibility, as well as a handful of crashes.

Finally, we fixed a handful of pesky problems across the app.

- The app now recognizes when you’ve finished uploading a GIF. (monty-burns-excellent.gif)
- “Hidden” posts now have a better description for their privacy status.
- The reader now scrolls to the top when you tap the status bar. Up, up, and away.
- The Menus screen properly creates menu items based on top-level pages.
- We fixed a block editor crash related to using text colors in older site themes.
- You shouldn’t run into any errors when you paste deeply nested content in the block editor. Much like onions, ogres, cakes, or parfaits, your content can have many layers.
